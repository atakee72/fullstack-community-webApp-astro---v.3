# Netlify Deployment Performance Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Session Establishment
**Problem**: Session not establishing after login on production
**Cause**:
- Auth client was using localhost URL in production
- Polling timeout was too aggressive with exponential backoff

**Solution**:
- Auth client now auto-detects production URL
- Optimized polling: 15 retries @ 200ms intervals (3 seconds total)
- Added immediate session check before polling

### 2. Like Button Responsiveness
**Problem**: Delayed UI updates when liking posts
**Cause**: No optimistic updates, 60-second cache time

**Solution**:
- Added optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
- Improved cache invalidation across all query variations
- Added immediate refetch after mutations

### 3. Content Update Delays
**Problem**: New posts/edits not showing immediately
**Cause**: Long cache times, no cache-control headers

**Solution**:
- Reduced React Query stale time: 30s → 5s
- Reduced cache time: 5min → 1min
- Added `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers to all API responses
- Added aggressive cache invalidation after mutations

## IMPORTANT: Netlify Environment Variables

**You MUST set this environment variable in Netlify Dashboard:**

```
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
```

Replace `your-netlify-app` with your actual Netlify subdomain.

### How to Set in Netlify:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Go to "Site configuration" → "Environment variables"
4. Add new variable:
   - Key: `PUBLIC_API_URL`
   - Value: Your full Netlify URL (e.g., `https://mahalle-community.netlify.app`)
5. Trigger a redeploy

### Other Required Environment Variables:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Your Better Auth secret
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret (for legacy compatibility)
- `CLOUD_NAME` - Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` - Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` - Cloudinary API secret

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/auth-client.ts** - Auto-detects production URL
2. **src/stores/authStore.better-auth.ts** - Optimized session polling
3. **src/hooks/api/useLikeMutation.ts** - Added optimistic updates
4. **src/hooks/api/useTopicsQuery.ts** - Improved cache invalidation
5. **src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx** - Reduced cache times
6. **API endpoints** - Added cache-control headers

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Login Test**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try logging in
   - Should establish session within 3 seconds

2. **Like Test**:
   - Click heart button
   - Should update instantly (optimistic)
   - Verify count persists after refresh

3. **Content Update Test**:
   - Create/edit a post
   - Should appear immediately
   - Other users should see it within 5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

If login still fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly in Netlify
3. Check Network tab - auth requests should go to Netlify URL, not localhost
4. Clear all browser data and try again

If updates are still slow:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check if API responses have cache-control headers
3. Verify MongoDB connection is stable

## Performance Notes

- **Session polling**: Max 3 seconds (15 attempts @ 200ms)
- **Cache freshness**: 5 seconds for forum data
- **Optimistic updates**: Instant UI feedback, server sync in background
- **Refetch on focus**: Automatically refreshes when tab regains focus
